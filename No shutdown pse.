Hello.

When I engrave with LaserGRBL, the computer shuts down as if there is no activity. At the same time, the laser is in full light when it happens until manually switches off to the engraver. This makes me unable to use the beautiful and easy-to-use program.

When others can prevent and shutdown the computer, LaserGRBL must also be able to learn it does not happen.

Best regards, Leif.
